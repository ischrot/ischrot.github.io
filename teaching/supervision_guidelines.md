**These guidelines are still under construction!**

## General Information

As part of a course on *Supervising Theses* in which I participated in order to acquire the *Baden-Württemberg-Zertifikat für Hochschuldidaktik* (= Higher Education Didactics Certificate Baden-Württemberg) I am currently developing guidelines for supervising theses. 

**These are my personal guidelines, i.e. if you are supervised by someone else, your supervisor might have different expectations and habits!** But, even if your thesis is not actually supervised by me, I believe that these guidelines can give you ideas how to structure the cooperation with your supervisor. Especially, they include some information about how and when to approach us if you would like to write your thesis with us.

These guidelines aim at making transparent
  - what you can expect from *me*
  - what I expect from *you*

when I am supervising your thesis.

**At first, this might sound deterrent and like a lot of work to you, but I am deeply convinced that on the contrary these guidelines actually simplify the process of writing a thesis and reduce the overall effort!**

The guidelines are mainly structured as a time line reaching from the [initial contact][init] to the [defense of your thesis][defense]. Each field is split into a part for the supervisor and one for the student, i.e. you. The section regarding the supervisor can be understood in the way that this is what *you can expect from me* (if I am your supervisor). The section regarding you has to be understood in the sense that this is *what I expect from you*. If you are supervised by somebody else, you can see these guidelines as suggestions for how you and your supervisor could shape your cooperation.

## Initial Contact

### When?
Ideally around 6 months before you want to register your thesis. 

### What?

<!-- **You:** 
- Contact the possible supervisor and ask whether the supervisor has the capacity to supervise a thesis in the time where you wish to write your thesis. Please contact [Prof. Dr. Ekaterina A. Kostina][ekaterina] if you wish to write your thesis in our group. 
- If you like, put me in CC, so that I can possibly contribute ideas or even supervise you. 
- If you already have a wish or a suggestions for the main topic of your thesis, inform the supervisor about it.

**Supervisor:** 
- Decide whether you have the capacity to supervise a thesis in the time where the student wishes to write the thesis. -->

| If you already have a wish or a suggestions for the main topic of your thesis, inform the supervisor about it. | | 

### What's next?

Until the first [organisational meeting][orga_meet]:

| You | Supervisor|
|-----|-----------|
| Formulate wishes or even suggestions regarding the main topic of your thesis - if your supervisor wants you to do so and not done so already. | Formulate suggestions regarding the main topic of the thesis or tell the student to formulate wishes or suggestions, see above. |
| If you have a wish or an idea already before the [organisational meeting][orga_meet], please inform the supervisor already before the next meeting. | If the student has told you an idea for a topic, try to develop this idea further if necessary. |
| If not done so yet, read these guidelines. | |

<!-- **You:** Formulate wishes or even suggestions regarding the main topic of your thesis - if your supervisor wants you to do so and not done so already. If you have a wish or an idea already before the [organisational meeting][orga_meet], please inform the supervisor already before the next meeting. 

**Supervisor:** Formulate suggestions regarding the main topic of the thesis or tell the student to formulate wishes or suggestions, see above. If the student has told you an idea for a topic, try to develop this idea further if necessary. -->

## Organisational Meeting

### When?

The latest 3 months before you want to register your thesis.

### What?

You and your supervisor meet for the first time to discuss the general conditions regarding your thesis. In particular, you discuss with your supervisor
  - your *honest* goals for the thesis,
  - how much time you can and want to invest into your thesis,
  - possibly other relevant obligations of yours.

Here it is important that you are honest in this discussion. It's perfectly fine if your goal is not to write the best thesis ever and invest every second of your life into it. However, it *is* problematic if you state the opposite and the expectations of you and your supervisor hence mismatch.
