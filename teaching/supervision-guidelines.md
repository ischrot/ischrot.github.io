**These guidelines are still under construction!**

## General Information

As part of a course on *Supervising Theses* in which I participated in order to acquire the *Baden-Württemberg-Zertifikat für Hochschuldidaktik* (= Higher Education Didactics Certificate Baden-Württemberg) I am currently developing guidelines for supervising theses. 

**These are my personal guidelines, i.e. if you are supervised by someone else, your supervisor might have different expectations and habits!** But, even if your thesis is not actually supervised by me, I believe that these guidelines can give you ideas how to structure the cooperation with your supervisor. Especially, they include some information about how and when to approach us if you would like to write your thesis with us.

These guidelines aim at making transparent
  - what you can expect from *me*
  - what I expect from *you*

when I am supervising your thesis.

**At first, this might sound deterrent and like a lot of work to you, but I am deeply convinced that on the contrary these guidelines actually simplify the process of writing a thesis and reduce the overall effort!**

The guidelines are mainly structured as a time line reaching from the [initial contact][init] to the [defense of your thesis][defense]. Each field is split into a part for the supervisor and one for the student, i.e. you. The section regarding the supervisor can be understood in the way that this is what *you can expect from me* (if I am your supervisor). The section regarding you has to be understood in the sense that this is *what I expect from you*. If you are supervised by somebody else, you can see these guidelines as suggestions for how you and your supervisor could shape your cooperation.
