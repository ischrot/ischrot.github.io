## General Information

Kick-Off Meeting Date
: Tuesday, April 26, 11:00, in SR1 (INF 205)

Date
: Tuesdays, 11:00 - 13:00

Room
: Seminarroom 1 (SR 1) in INF 205 
  We meet in person.
  {:.note}

Level:
: Master Students (Bachelor students with relevant experience and motivation are welcome, too, though!)
  We offer a [proseminar][prosem] for Bachelor students only, too.
  {:.note}

Language
: English

Requirements
: You should have attended at least the following courses:
    - Analysis 1, 2
    - Linear Algebra 1
    - Nonlinear Optimization

  You can of course still join the seminar if you are missing one of these courses, but we strongly recommend that you attend the missing course in parallel then. The experience is that students without knowledge in these areas have problems with the topics of this seminar.

## Topics

The following topics are preliminary only. The final topics will be discussed in the [kick-off meeting][kom].
{:.note title="Important"}
1. CG-Methods
2. Active set methods for NLPs with vanishing constraints
3. Penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods
4. SQP with indefinite Hessian approximations
5. BFGS-SQP Method for nonsmooth, nonconvex, constrained optimization
6. Interior-point filter line-search algorithm for NLP
7. A dual Newton strategy for the efficient soulution of sparse QPs arising in SQP-based nonlinear model predictive control
8. Global optimization methods
9. Robust optimization

## Goal of the Seminar
> **Teach** your fellow students your topic in an understandable yet professional way!
{:.lead}

## Expectations
In order to complete the seminar successfully you have to
  - attend the weekly meetings,
  - prepare and do a presentation of 90min (+10min discussion) in pairs.

You do not need to write an essay.
{:.note}

Further we expect
  - a thorough understanding of your topic,
  - professional display and communication of Mathematics,
  - scientific literature work,
  - a professional presentation (the presentation technique is up to you).
