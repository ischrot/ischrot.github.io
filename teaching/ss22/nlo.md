Level:
: Bachelor and Master

Language
: English

Requirements
: You should have attended at least the following courses:
    - Analysis 1, 2
    - Linear Algebra 1
  
  Additionally, having attended the following courses is beneficial but not necessary:
    - Basics of Optimization
    - Introduction to Numerics
    
  We will have programming exercises that have to be solved in Python, so it is beneficial if you have some experience with Python already, but we keep the exercises beginner-friendly, so that it is no problem if you have not used Python before.

  You can of course still join the course if you are missing one of these requirements, but we recommend that you acquire the missing knowledge in parallel then.

Registration
: To participate in the seminar, please register for the course on [MÃœSLI][muesli].
  
  At the moment only 45 persons can hand in exercises as we were not allowed a second tutor so far. But once enough people have signed up on the waiting list, we will ask for another tutor. Moreover, usually many people still leave the course in the first weeks. Therefore, it is possible that some spots become available again. Hence, we invite you all to join for the first lecture. Of course, everybody who likes to can attend the lecture anyways (but not hand in exercises).
  {:.note title="Regarding the limited number of spots"}
