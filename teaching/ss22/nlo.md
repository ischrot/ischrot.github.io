  - Thursdays, 16:15 - 17:45, SR 4
  
  Depending on whether we get an additional tutor, we will offer tutorials at all three dates or only at two of them. We will inform you again once you can choose your tutorial group on [MÜSLI][muesli].
  {:.note}
  <!--   We will choose two out of these three dates based on the outcome of a poll that we will launch in the first lecture and that will be linked here, too. -->

Platform for anonymous questions and feedback
: We understand that sometimes you would like to ask a question or provide feedback anonymously. You can do that on [Particify][ars]. Just enter the code *3535 6496* or go directly to [our room][arsroom] and then post your question or feedback in the Q\&A section. We will regularly check the Q\&A section and answer your questions there.

Level 
: Bachelor and Master

Language
: English

Requirements
: You should have attended at least the following courses:
    - Analysis 1, 2
    - Linear Algebra 1
  
  Additionally, having attended the following courses is beneficial but not necessary:
    - Basics of Optimization
    - Introduction to Numerics
    
  We will have programming exercises that have to be solved in Python, so it is beneficial if you have some experience with Python already, but we keep the exercises beginner-friendly, so that it is no problem if you have not used Python before.

  You can of course still join the course if you are missing one of these requirements, but we recommend that you acquire the missing knowledge in parallel then.
  {:.note}
  
Registration
: To participate in the course, please register for the course on [MÜSLI][muesli].
  
  We have decided to include everybody in the course. Please take a look at the grading, correction and feedback of the exercise sheets below though.

## Exercises

Sheets
: | Sheet | Deadline | Notebook Template | Solutions | Comments |
  |-------|----------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
  | [Tutorial sheet][sheettut] | None | | None | Tutorial notebooks\: [python\_for\_nlo][nbtut1] [python_tut_cebulla][nbtut2] |
  | [Sheet 1][sheet1]  | May 13th, 08:00am | [Template 01][temp1], [Auxiliary Functions 01][aux1]  | | |
  | Sheet 2 | May 27th, 08:00am | | | |

  | Sheet 4 | June 24th, 08:00am | | | |
  | Sheet 5 | July 8th, 08:00am  | | | |
  

General format
: - **One** exercise sheet every **two** weeks
  - The first exercise sheet will be published April 29.
  - 5 (graded) exercise sheets with 40 points of theoretical exercises and one programming exercise per sheet. See below for more information on the grading.
  - Release: Fridays (biweekly) on [MaMpf][mampf] and in the table above.
  - Submission deadline: Fridays (biweekly) until 08:00am on [MaMpf][mampf]
  - Submission procedure see below.
  - Work in teams allowed **and encouraged** with up to 3 persons per team
  - Information on the correction and the feedback see below.
<!--   - The tutor can ask/allow you to revise your programming exercise once per sheet. -->
  - Solutions can be written in English and German.
  - Plagiarism leads to 0 points for all involved teams (that also applies to plagiarism of the solutions from the winter term 20/21)!
  <!-- - Sample solutions? -->
  
Programming exercises format
: - Programming language: Python
  - You get templates that you have to complete.
  - The templates are a single Jupyter notebook for each sheet (sometimes accompanied by a Python file with auxiliary functions)
  - A Python tutorial will be available soon.

Submission procedure
: - Both the theoretical and the programming exercises are submitted digitally.
  - The solutions to the theoretical questions have to be submitted as **one PDF** file. Solutions created in LaTeX are allowed as long as the names of the team members are also added using LateX. If you scan handwritten solutions, please make sure that the solutions remain readable and have a moderate file size! Digitally handwritten solutions are accepted, too.
  - The programming exercises have to be submitted as **one Jupyter notebook**.
  - The Jupyter notebooks have to include the created outputs, like plots and logging outputs.
  - The PDF and the Jupyter notebook have then to be added to a **ZIP-archive**.
  - The notebooks, PDFs, and archives have an obligatory naming scheme. Please name your files \<sheet numer (2 digits!)\>\_\<Last name1\>(\_\<Last name2\>\_\<Last name3\>).ipynb/pdf/zip, i.e. for example **01_Femmer_Kostina_Schrot.ipynb**. (Do not use the angle brackets and adjust the number of names according to your team size).
  - Write down your name(s) at the beginning of your theoretical solutions and at the beginning of your Jupyter notebooks. It is not sufficient to have your names only in the file name.
  - Upload your solutions until Friday (biweekly), 08:00am on [MaMpf][mampf].
  - A guide how to submit solutions on [MaMpf][mampf] can be found [here][subguide].

Grading, correction and feedback
: Due to the high number of participants, we cannot correct and provide individual feedback to all submissions. Instead we apply the following procedure:
  - For each sheet we choose a number of submissions for correction of the theoretical exercises on a random basis.
  - The selected submissions will be corrected as usual. This means in particular that you will receive some written feedback to your solutions.
  - For all other submissions we only check to which exercises you have provided (reasonable) solution attempts and award the full amount of points for these exercises. 
  - We will check the programming exercises of all submissions. But, to reduce the workload for Laura, you don't get feedback to your programming exercises. Moreover, there will not be the option to revise your programming exercise. Instead, you either get 1P if everything is fine, 0.5P if most parts of the exercise have been solved and there are only minor flaws, 0P otherwise.
  - We will upload the solutions to both the theoretical and programming exercises after you have submitted your solutions so that you can compare your own solutions with the suggested solutions. We will dedicate some time in the tutorials to then answer specific questions regarding your solutions. **Send your questions to [Laura][laura] at least three days before the tutorial.** 
  
  To make sure that the grading of the theoretical exercises is as fair as possible, we will make sure that each group has its solutions checked similarly often.
  {:.note}


## Lecture Format

The lectures take place in person and in a "classical" format, i.e. Prof. Kostina will present the lecture content in the lectures.

Handwritten lecture notes will be uploaded on [MaMpf][mampf]. Moreover, lecture notes from the course in the winter term 2020/2021 are available, see [other materials][material].

## Tutorial Format

We will alternate between two different formats: A [*collaborative working session*][ws] and the [*presentation of solutions*][sol].

We want to make sure that the tutorials are as effective as possible for you, so we can possibly still adjust the formats to your needs. Therefore, feedback is always welcome.
{:.note}

### Collaborative working sessions

What?
: In these sessions we invite you to come to the seminarroom to work together with your own and other groups on the exercises. Moreover, Laura and myself will be there to help if you have problems or questions. In particular, we can discuss programming related issues here.

  The spirit of these sessions is less the one of a "classical" tutorial, but more the one of an interactive group meeting. Especially, Laura and I will not prepare anything unless you have asked us for something specific.
  {:.note}

When?
: In the second week after you submitted your solutions/the new exercise sheet has been published. Moreover, we have an additional meeting at the beginning and one at the end of the semester. I.e., the dates are:

  | Mondays | Thursdays | Topic |
  |---------|-----------|-------|
  | 02.05. | 05.05. | Setting up the Conda environments and the Python tutorials; possibly we will say a few words about debugging and Git |
  | 09.05. | 12.05. | Working on the 1st exercise sheet |
  | 23.05. | 26.05. | Working on the 2nd exercise sheet |

  | 20.06. | 23.06. | Working on the 4th exercise sheet |
  | 04.07. | 07.07. | Working on the 5th exercise sheet |
  | *TBA* | *TBA* | Exam preparation |

### Presentation of solutions

What?
: In these tutorials Laura will present (some of the) solutions of the previous exercise sheet and answer specific questions to your solutions. **Send your questions to [Laura][laura] at least three days before the tutorial.** 

When?
: In the first week after you submitted your solutions/the new exercise sheet has been published. I.e., the dates are:
  
  | Mondays | Thursdays | Topic |
  |---------|-----------|-------|
  | 16.05. | 19.05. | Discussing solutions of the 1st exercise sheet |
  | 30.05. | 02.06. | Discussing solutions of the 2nd exercise sheet |
  | 13.06. | 16.06. | Discussing solutions of the 3rd exercise sheet |
