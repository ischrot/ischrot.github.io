Lecture Dates
: - Mondays, 11:00 - 13:00
  - Thursdays, 11:00 - 13:00

Lecture Room

Tutorial Groups:
: - Mondays, 16:15 - 17:45, SR 1
  - Thursdays, 09:15 - 10:45, SR 1
  - Thursdays, 16:15 - 17:45, SR 4

  We will choose two out of these three dates based on the outcome of a poll that we will launch in the first lecture and that will be linked here, too.
  {:.note}
  
Level:
: Bachelor and Master

Language
: English

Requirements
: You should have attended at least the following courses:
    - Analysis 1, 2
    - Linear Algebra 1
  
  Additionally, having attended the following courses is beneficial but not necessary:
    - Basics of Optimization
    - Introduction to Numerics
    
  We will have programming exercises that have to be solved in Python, so it is beneficial if you have some experience with Python already, but we keep the exercises beginner-friendly, so that it is no problem if you have not used Python before.

  You can of course still join the course if you are missing one of these requirements, but we recommend that you acquire the missing knowledge in parallel then.
  {:.note}
  
Registration
: To participate in the seminar, please register for the course on [MÜSLI][muesli].
  
  At the moment only 45 persons can hand in exercises as we were not allowed a second tutor so far. But once enough people have signed up on the waiting list, we will ask for another tutor. Moreover, usually many people still leave the course in the first weeks. Therefore, it is possible that some spots become available again. Hence, we invite you all to join for the first lecture. Of course, everybody who likes to can attend the lecture anyways (but not hand in exercises).
  {:.note title="Regarding the limited number of spots"}

## Lecture Format

The lectures take place in person and in a "classical" format, i.e. Prof. Kostina will present the lecture content in the lectures.

Handwritten lecture notes are available from the course in the winter term 2020/2021, see [other materials][material].

## Exercise Format

General format
: - **One** exercise sheet every **two** weeks
  - The first exercise sheet will be published April 29.
  - 5 (graded) exercise sheets with 40 points of theoretical exercises and one programming exercise per sheet
  - Release: Fridays (biweekly) at *TBA* on *TBA*
  - Submission deadline: Fridays (biweekly) until 08:00am 
  - Submission procedure see below.
  - Work in teams allowed **and encouraged** with up to 3 persons per team
  - Feedback in the [tutorials][tuts]
  - The tutor can ask/allow you to revise your programming exercise once per sheet.
  - Solutions can be written in English and German.
  - Plagiarism leads to 0 points for all involved teams.
  <!-- - Sample solutions? -->
  
Programming exercises format
: - Programming language: Python
  - You get templates that you have to complete.
  - The templates are a single Jupyter notebook for each sheet (sometimes accompanied by a Python file with auxiliary functions)
  - A Python tutorial will be available soon.

Submission procedure
: - Both the theoretical and the programming exercises are submitted digitally.
  - The solutions to the theoretical questions have to be submitted as **one PDF** file. Solutions created in LaTeX are allowed as long as the names of the team members are also added using LateX. If you scan handwritten solutions, please make sure that the solutions remain readable and have a moderate file size! Digitally handwritten solutions are accepted, too.
  - The programming exercises have to be submitted as **one Jupyter notebook**.
  - The Jupyter notebooks have to include the created outputs, like plots and logging outputs.
  - The PDF and the Jupyter notebook have then to be added to a **ZIP-archive**.
  - The notebooks, PDFs, and archives have an obligatory naming scheme. Please name your files \<sheet numer (2 digits!)\>\_\<Last name1\>(\_\<Last name2\>\_\<Last name3\>).ipynb/pdf/zip, i.e. for example **01_Femmer_Kostina_Schrot.ipynb**. (Do not use the angle brackets and adjust the number of names according to your team size).
  - Write down your name(s) at the beginning of your theoretical solutions and at the beginning of your Jupyter notebooks. It is not sufficient to have your names only in the file name.
  - Upload your solutions until Friday (biweekly), 08:00am (where is still *TBA*)

## Tutorial Format

*TBA*

## Final Exam

Admission Requirements
: - at least 50% of the points in the theoretical exercises **and** 3 out of 5 programming exercises solved
  
  If you have an old admission, contact [me][ihno] as soon as possible.
  {:.note}
  
Exam Format
: - Written exam of 120min
  - No programming project
  - Theoretical and programming related questions (no coding on paper however)
  - Date: *TBA*
