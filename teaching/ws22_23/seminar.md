## General Information

Organizers
: - [Prof. Dr. Ekaterina A. Kostina][ekaterina]
  - [Ihno Schrot][ihno]
  - [Marta Sauter][marta]
  
  Please contact [Ihno Schrot][ihno] if you have questions regarding this seminar.
  {:.note title="Contact"}

Kick-Off Meeting Date
: Monday, 17.10.

<!-- Tuesday, April 26, 11:15, in SR1 (INF 205) -->

Date
: Mondays, 14:15 - 15:45

Room
: Seminarroom 4 (SR 4) in INF 205 
  
  We meet in person.
  {:.note}

Level:
: Master Students (Bachelor students with relevant experience and motivation are welcome, too, though!)

Language
: English

Requirements
: You should have attended at least the following courses:
    - Analysis 1, 2
    - Linear Algebra 1
    - Nonlinear Optimization

  You can of course still join the seminar if you are missing one of these courses, but we strongly recommend that you attend the missing course in parallel then. The experience is that students without knowledge in these areas have problems with the topics of this seminar.
  {:.note}
  
Registration
: To participate in the seminar, please register for the seminar on [MÜSLI][muesli]. The number of participants is limited to 18.

## Kick-Off Meeting
The kick-off meeting takes place on Monday, 17.10., 14:15, in SR 4 (INF 205). Here, we 
  - discuss organizational matters,
  - form pairs if necessary,
  - **distribute** the topics,
  - discuss the schedule.

## Topics

We have talks from three different fields on offer. We will agree on a field in the [kick-off meeting][kom]. Literature suggestions can be found [below][lit].

### Methods for Nonlinear Optimization Problems

1. CG-Methods
2. Penalty and Augmented Lagrangian methods
3. SQP with Indefinite Hessian Approximations
4. BFGS-SQP Method for Nonsmooth, Nonconvex, Constrained Optimization
5. Interior-Point Filter Line-Search Algorithm for NLP
6. Global Optimization Methods
7. Robust Nonconvex Optimization

### Optimization for Data Science
_TBA_

### Model Order Reduction
1. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
2. Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM)
3. Reduced Basis Methods (RB)
4. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
5. Derivative Extended POD (DEPOD)
6. Balanced Truncation
7. Rational Interpolation

## Goal of the Seminar
> **Teach** your fellow students your topic in an understandable yet professional way!
{:.lead}

## Expectations
In order to complete the seminar successfully you have to
  - attend the weekly meetings,
  - prepare and do a presentation of 90min (+10min discussion) in pairs <!--*or* 45min (+5min discussion) alone.-->

You do not need to write an essay.
{:.note}

Further we expect
  - a thorough understanding of your topic,
  - professional display and communication of Mathematics,
  - scientific literature work,
  - a professional presentation (the presentation technique is up to you).

## Schedule

| Date | Topic | Speaker(s) |
|------|-------|------------|
| 17.10. | Kick-off meetig | None |


<!-- | May 24th | Active set methods for NLPs with vanishing constraints | Laura |
| May 31st | A dual Newton strategy for the efficient soulution of sparse QPs arising in SQP-based nonlinear model predictive control | Jörn, Szymon | -->

<!-- | None | Robust nonconvex optimization | None | -->
The speakers will be decided in the [kick-off meeting][kom].

## Grading

We primarly rate your talks based on [this rubric][rubric].

## Literature 

We expect you to identify and use further literature if necessary on your own! The following literature suggestions are to be understood as starting points.
