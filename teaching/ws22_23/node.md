: - [Laura Femmer][laura]

<!-- First Lecture
: Monday, October 17, 11:15, in SR B in INF 205 (Mathematikon)  -->

Lecture and Tutorial Dates
: Lectures

  {:.note}

Level 
: Bachelor and Master

Language
: English

Requirements
: You should have attended at least the following courses:
    - Analysis 1, 2
    - Linear Algebra 1
    - Nonlinear Optimization
  
  Additionally, having attended the following courses is beneficial but not necessary:
    - Numerics of ODEs
    
  We will have programming exercises that have to be solved in Python, so it is beneficial if you have some experience with Python already, but we keep the exercises beginner-friendly, so that it is no problem if you have not used Python before.

  You can of course still join the course if you are missing one of these requirements, but we recommend that you acquire the missing knowledge in parallel then.

Registration
: To participate in the course, please register for the course on [MÜSLI][muesli].

  | [Sheet 06][sheet6] | February 10th, 2023 | [Theor. Exe. 06][theosol6] [Prog. Exe. 06][progsol6] | Update (February 06th): All exercises are considered for the evaluation. In Programming Exercise 6 the reference to the tutorial notebook, which includes an example usage of SLSQP, has been fixed. |

General format
: - **One** exercise sheet every **two** weeks
  - The first exercise sheet will be published on Friday, October 28th.
  - We plan to have 6 (graded) exercise sheets with 20 points of theoretical exercises and 10 points of programming exercise per sheet.
  - Release: Fridays (biweekly) on [MaMpf][mampf] and in the table above.
  - Submission deadline: Fridays (biweekly) until 08:00am on [MaMpf][mampf]
  - Submission procedure see below.
  - Work in teams allowed **and encouraged** with up to 3 persons per team
  - Solutions can be written in English and German.
  - Plagiarism leads to 0 points for all involved teams (that also applies to plagiarism of the solutions from the summer term 2021)!
  - Sample solutions will be uploaded in [MaMpf][mampf] and linked in the table above.
  - Programming language: Python
  - The programming exercises are to be solved using Jupyter notebooks.

Submission procedure
: - Both the theoretical and the programming exercises are submitted digitally.
  - The solutions to the theoretical questions have to be submitted as **one PDF** file. Solutions created in LaTeX are allowed. If you scan handwritten solutions, please make sure that the solutions remain readable and have a moderate file size! Digitally handwritten solutions are accepted, too.
  - The programming exercises have to be submitted as **one Jupyter notebook**.
  - The Jupyter notebooks have to include the created outputs, like plots and logging outputs.
  - The PDF and the Jupyter notebook have then to be added to a **ZIP-archive**.
  - The notebooks, PDFs, and archives have an obligatory naming scheme. Please name your files \<Last name1\>(\_\<Last name2\>\_\<Last name3\>)_\<sheet numer (2 digits!)\>\.ipynb/pdf/zip, i.e. for example **Femmer_Kostina_Schrot_01.ipynb**. (Do not use the angle brackets and adjust the number of names according to your team size).
  - Write down your name(s) at the beginning of your theoretical solutions and at the beginning of your Jupyter notebooks. It is not sufficient to have your names only in the file name.
  - Upload your solutions until Friday (biweekly), 08:00am on [MaMpf][mampf].
  - A guide how to submit solutions on [MaMpf][mampf] can be found [here][subguide].
  - You receive feedback from Laura via MaMpf, too.
  - Solutions will be presented in the [tutorial][tuts].

## Lecture

The lectures take place in person and in a "classical" format, i.e. Prof. Kostina will present the lecture content in the lectures.

Handwritten lecture notes will be uploaded on [MaMpf][mampf]. Moreover, lecture notes from the course in the summer term 2021 are available, see [other materials][material].

## Tutorial

What?
: In these tutorials [Laura][laura] will present (some of the) solutions of the previous exercise sheet and answer specific questions to your solutions.

When?
: In the first week after you submitted your solutions, i.e., the dates are:
  
  | Date | Topic |
  |------|-------|
  | October 25th | Help desk for the Python tutorial |
  | November 15th | Discussing solutions of the 1st exercise sheet |
  | November 29th | Discussing solutions of the 2nd exercise sheet |
  | December 13th | Discussing solutions of the 3rd exercise sheet |
  | January 10th  | Discussing solutions of the 4th exercise sheet |
  | January 24th  | Discussing solutions of the 5th exercise sheet |
  | February 14th | Discussing solutions of the 6th exercise sheet |

We want to make sure that the tutorials are as effective as possible for you, so we can possibly still adjust the formats to your needs. Therefore, feedback is always welcome.

## Final Exam

Admission Requirements
: - at least 50% of the points in the theoretical exercises **and** 50% of the points in the programming exercises.
  
  If you have an old admission, contact [me][ihno] as soon as possible.

    Please arrive 15min earlier!
    {:.note title="Important"}

  - Written exam of 120min
  - No programming project
  - Theoretical and programming related questions (no coding on paper however)
  - The exam is not an open book exam. In fact, you are not allowed to bring any materials into the exam, i.e. you are not allowed to use cheat sheets or similar.
  - [Exam Preparation Sheet][exprep] In this document you find general information about the exam and materials for the exam preparation including a list of the most relevant exercises and a list of questions.

Registration
: - There won't be a dedicated registration for the first exam. Instead, everyone who has passed the admission requirements for the exam, will be registered for the first exam.
  - For the second exam, everyone who has failed the first exam or missed the exam due to illness - in this case a doctor's note is required! - or who have sent [me][ihno] an email before the first exam stating that they only want to take the second exam, will be automatically registered.
  - Note that there will be no more exam dates than these two (16.02, 14.04). This means that if you miss the second exam due to illness, you won't have another chance to take the exam this semester.
  - If you plan to miss an exam for which you have been registered, please send [me][ihno] an email as soon as possible.
