Registration
: To participate in the seminar, please register on [MÜSLI][muesli]. If the registration is full on [MÜSLI][muesli], you can send an e-mail to [Hridya Varma][hridya] to be added to the waiting list.

## Kick-Off Meeting
The kick-off meeting will take place on October 16, 2023. Here, we will explain the seminar format, our goals and expectations, discuss organizational matters and present the planned schedule for the seminar. 

## Topics

Below you can find a tentative list of the topics that we offer along with *some literature suggestions (TO DO)*. We plan to have 8 presentations on 8 different topics. 

1. Single-species and interacting population models in ecology
2. Integro-difference equations in spatial ecology
3. Delay differential equations and their applications in biology
4. Compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology
5. Modelling chemical reactions and gene regulatory networks
6. Reaction-diffusion models for biological pattern formation
7. Cellular automata approach to biological modelling
8. Population genetics and adaptive dynamics

This list may be updated once again before the kick-off meeting, so please watch out for any changes.

After the kick-off meeting on October 16, 2023, you will have one week to look into the offered topics and send your top 3 preferred topics along with a short note on your mathematical background to [Hridya Varma][hridya]. Please send the e-mail by 10:00 on Monday October 23, 2023. We will then try to distribute the topics according to your preferences keeping in mind your mathematical background. You will be assigned a topic by October 25, 2023.

## Goals of the Seminar
- Explore the world of mathematical modelling in biology
- Share your knowledge with your peers by presenting your topic in an engaging and understandable way
- Learn how to present a complex topic in any length of time

## Expectations
In order to complete the seminar successfully, you have to:
  - attend the weekly meetings
  - present your topic in 5 minutes at the pitch session
  - present your topic in 45 minutes (+ 15 minutes discussion)
  - actively participate in the discussion and give constructive feedback to your peers
  - provide a 1-2 page handout for the 45-minute talk
