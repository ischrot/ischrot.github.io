Registration
: To participate in the seminar, please register on [MÜSLI][muesli]. If the registration is full on [MÜSLI][muesli], you can send an e-mail to [Hridya Varma][hridya] to be added to the waiting list.

## Kick-Off Meeting
The kick-off meeting will take place on October 16, 2023. Here, we will explain the seminar format, our goals and expectations, discuss organizational matters and present the planned schedule for the seminar. 

## Topics

Below you can find a tentative list of the topics that we offer along with some [literature suggestions][lit]. We plan to have 8 presentations on 8 different topics. 

1. Single-species and interacting population models in ecology
2. Integro-difference equations in spatial ecology
3. Delay differential equations and their applications in biology
4. Compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology
5. Modelling chemical reactions and gene regulatory networks
6. Reaction-diffusion models for biological pattern formation
7. Cellular automata approach to biological modelling
8. Evolutionary game theory

After the kick-off meeting on October 16, 2023, you will have one week to look into the offered topics and send your top 3 preferred topics along with a short note on your mathematical background to [Hridya Varma][hridya]. Please send the e-mail by 10:00 on Monday October 23, 2023. We will then try to distribute the topics according to your preferences keeping in mind your mathematical background. You will be assigned a topic by October 25, 2023.

## Goals of the Seminar
- Explore the world of mathematical modelling in biology
- Share your knowledge with your peers by presenting your topic in an engaging and understandable way
- Learn how to present a complex topic in any length of time

## Expectations
In order to complete the seminar successfully, you have to:
  - attend the weekly meetings
  - present your topic in 5 minutes at the pitch session
  - present your topic in 45 minutes (+ 15 minutes discussion)
  - actively participate in the discussion and give constructive feedback to your peers
  - provide a 1-2 page handout for the 45-minute talk

## Grading

We primarly rate your talks based on [this rubric][rubric].

## Literature

Here you will find some literature suggestions. These are only meant to be used as a starting point. We expect you to identify further literature as necessary on your own.

You can find all the following literature online when you are connected to the university network. Alternatively, you can also find them in this [heiBOX folder][heibox]. The password for this folder will be shared at the kick-off meeting.

Please remember that the goal of this seminar is not to present all the contents of the literature. This is unrealistic and will make it difficult for your audience to understand your talk. The literature is meant to help you get a good understanding of the topic, so that you can summarize your learnings and present it to your peers in a way they can understand.
