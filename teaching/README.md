## Theses

### General Information

Usually I do not directly provide topics or supervise theses. However, our workgroup usually can offer you topics. Please contact [Prof. Dr. Ekaterina A. Kostina][ekaterina] if you wish to write your thesis in our group. If you like, put me in CC, so that I can possibly contribute ideas or even supervise you.

**The [guidelines][gl_internal] below include some information about how and when to approach us if you would like to write your thesis with us.** 

### [Supervision Guidelines][guidelines]

As part of a course on *Supervising Theses* in which I participated in order to acquire the *Baden-Württemberg-Zertifikat für Hochschuldidaktik* (= Higher Education Didactics Certificate Baden-Württemberg) I am currently developing guidelines for supervising theses. 

**These are my personal guidelines, i.e. if you are supervised by someone else your supervisor might have different expectations and habits!** But, even if your thesis is not actually supervised by me, I believe that these guidelines can give you ideas how to structure the cooperation with your supervisor. Especially, they include some information about how and when to approach us if you would like to write your thesis with us.

These guidelines aim at making transparent
  - what you can expect from *me*
  - what I expect from *you*
when I am supervising your thesis.

**At first, this might sound deterrent and like a lot of work to you, but I am deeply convinced that on the contrary these guidelines actually simplify the process of writing a thesis and reduce the overall effort!**

The guidelines (still under construction) can be found [here][guidelines].
